# "Results Processing"
### Description
This **very imaginatively** named repo should contain (if I remember that it exists) many notebooks preprocessing and plotting result data coming from different project.
If they are not too big, I'll upload the files containing the data for better version control, otherwise I'll document how to get them (from Ushelf or something).

I'll try to keep in `CHANGELOGS.md` the different project I used this repo with (i.e., which file was created for which data/purpose).
