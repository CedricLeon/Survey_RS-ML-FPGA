# "Results Processing"
### Description
This **very imaginatively** named repo should contain (if I remember that it exists) many notebooks preprocessing and plotting result data coming from different project.
If they are not too big, I'll upload the files containing the data for better version control, otherwise I'll document how to get them (from Ushelf or something).

I'll try to keep in `CHANGELOGS.md` the different project I used this repo with (i.e., which file was created for which data/purpose).

### Project structure
The very idea of keeping the synthesis of the results of different projects at the same place is to easily be able to reuse some code or data formats, get inspiration from old plots, etc. Therefore, code and data in folders like `logs` or `notebooks` are stored in a happy mix, everyone next to each other, no favoritism.
For the sake of staying sane, I will keep `data` and `results` organized in sub-folders for each projects.
